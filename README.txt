	BUILDING:

OS X: There is an included XCode project file for building the static library and demo application. Alteratively you could use the CMake files.

UNIX: A forum user was kind enough to make a set of CMake files for Chipmunk. This will require you to have CMake installed. To build run 'cmake .' then 'make'. This should build a dynamic library, a static library, and the demo application.

Windows: There is an included MSVC project for building the library and demo application.

Ruby: I maintain a Ruby extension for Chipmunk. I've been toying around with using SCons for other projects, and at the moment this is the only good way to build the Ruby extension unless somebody wants to step up and help make a proper Ruby build script.
